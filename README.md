# What Makes a Woman?
### Description
For this visualization I wanted to show how woman in the Smithsonian are represented through the topics they are tagged with. I looked at the portraits of women in The National Portrait Gallery and The Smithsonian American Art Museum. I chose to look at portraits because historically portraits were only painted of prominent figures and I wanted to see what women were classified as important enough to have a portrait made of them and why.

I decided to only analyze portraits in the years 1900-1950. I narrowed down on these dates so I would be looking at 20 years before the 19th Amendment was passed and about 20 years after. I wanted to see the change that occured before and after the women's rights movement.

The visualization is split up into a graph showing a count of the number of portraits with each topic and a gallery of portraits showing the portraits from each year represented. 

For the graph, I split topics into 7 categories. These categories are Science and Technology, Government, Writers, Domestic, Sports, Entertainment, and Activism. I grouped topics pertaining to this categories into these 7 areas. I grouped Health and Wellness into the Science and Technology category and Government consists of women who worked in government and first ladies. 

## Iteration 1

### Color Scheme Change
I changed the color scheme after multiple comments that my original choice was biased. I decided on a more neutral palette. The new color palette is:

## Final Iteration
The final visualization can be found at https://isabelstoddart.github.io/MS1QuantitativeData/

The final dataset used is topicsData.json

I have included screen shots below. The first shows the home page and the second and third show the graph and the portrait gallery.



Changes made from iteration 1:
* The graph now counts for portraits, not for topics. So, as before each individual topic in a category was counted, now each portrait is only counted once per category even if it has multiple tags from one category.
* I added portraits from The Smithsonian American Art Museum as well to have a bigger dataset
* I added the portrait gallery so the user can see all of the portraits from the graph

### Possible Explanation on Topic Variety (Something to think about):
An important thing to note is that looking beyond woman’s representation throughout the years, the national portrait gallery and the smithsonian american art msueum just might not have portraits of women in particular fields (they may be missing from the CC0 enabled data but also may be missing from the collection as a whole). So, it may go beyond women’s representation in these actual fields and be more about the collection of women’s portraits that The NPG has.
